                <p>This app enables you to create, store, and generate passwords. While we did our part to make it as secure as possible, we cannot guarentee inpenetribility. Be sure to use other features of your phone like: password protecting it or using fingerprint security. Also, there is no guarentee that your passwords will not be lost. To ensure complete saftey of passwords, we implemented a feature that downloads the passwords into an external file for your safe keeping. Also, sometimes pencil and paper is the best backup you can use. Thanks for using this app. We hope it is useful and provides convienence.</p>
